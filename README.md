## Description

As part of my research work in particle physics, I have used a number of machine learning techniques for data analysis, especially for signal and background separation and classification, where signal encompasses particle events I am interested to look at further. I did this course to gain some experience with analyzing other kinds of datasets in the industry.

This contains some projects I worked on for the course on Machine learning in Coursera (Andrew Ng)

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

The language used is Matlab

This is an advanced and pretty extensive course which explored different examples and real-life scenarious like fraud detection, spam classification, pattern recognition (hand-written digits) and other data, and explores different machine learning models like linear and logistic regression, neural networks, boosted decision trees, Support vector machines, K-means and other clustering algorithms.This course requires understanding and implementation of parts of the machine learning algorithms.

* Ex1:
In exercise 1, we implement a Linear regression model which predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, introduce notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning. The codes which implement these are costFunction, gradientDescent and so on.

* Ex2:
In this exercise, we build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

## Usage:
 The assignments require the Octave or MATLAB scientific computing languages.
 
•	Octave is a free, open-source application available for many platforms. It has a text interface and an experimental graphical one.

•	MATLAB is proprietary software, but a free trial license to MATLAB Online was offered for the completion of this course.

You can startup Octave and run the exercises in Octave as for example:

Type the method: warmUpExercise() which will run the code warmUpExercise()

Or you can run the exercises in Matlab Online: https://matlab.mathworks.com
